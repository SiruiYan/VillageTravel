# VillageTravel

Deep in the mountains of Concurrencia lies a cluster of historic villages. The villages are perched high in the mountains and accessible from the outside world by a cable car connecting them to the valley below. Travel between the villages is by means of mountain railway. The cable car terminus and each of the villages are connected to their two neighbouring in a ring topology. This project simulates the travel between villages.
